Sternotomy wires are stable.    Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again demonstrated and stable  from the prior studies.  Mediastinal contours are similar.  There is moderate  pulmonary edema, increased from the prior examination done on ___.  The  focal opacity seen at the right lung base could represent an area of  atelectasis and effusion however infection should be considered.  There may be  a small left pleural effusion. Visualized osseous structures are stable."

Patient is rotated to her right, which limits the evaluation.  There is  persistent pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions noted, size cannot  be assessed.  No pneumothorax is seen.    Degenerative changes of the left shoulder again noted."
C:/Users/lenovo/Desktop/mimic-cxr-reports/files/p19\p19998843\s56350227.txt,"In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased  opacification at the right base.  The configuration suggests atelectasis,  though in the appropriate clinical setting a supervening pneumonia would have  to be considered.  On the left, there is again opacification at the base with  obscuration of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and  substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.    No definite vascular congestion.  The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube  remain in unchanged position."
